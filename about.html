        <p>
            I am a recent graduate from a Software Engineering
        program through Arizona State University. I have a passion
        for problem solving and have a knack for seeing how
        smaller parts work together in a system.

            I have some informal experience doing contracted
        software development for a psychiatrist which involved
        migrating web applications from separate servers on to a
        single Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud server. I also
        troubleshooted and maintaining those applications, and
        made both aesthetic and functional improvements to the
        company's web site.

            For the capstone project required to complete my
        degree, I worked with a team of four others to create a web
        editor that used web Bluetooth to connect to an ESP32
        board that would run and compile MicroPython code.

            I am in awe with how quickly technology evolves and I
        love the aspect of continual growth from working in
        a career with it.
